## Aims
* Create functions in javascript to perform mathematical operations on numbers saved as strings. The motivation of this is to expand the range of numbers that can be saved and manipulated beyond what is possible with standard datatypes.
* Investigate writing the algorithms in C++ and utilising them in javascript and any efficiency benefits
* Possibly look at creating a module from the resulting functions

## Technologies
* Javascript
* Mocha + chai module
* C++

## Tasks

### In Progress
* Significant refactoring is required at minimum to reduce repetition though currently an alternative approach is being considered. Potentially examining ideas in a new branch would be prudent.  
* Modify code to be contained in Class/classes
* Extend code to function with decimal inputs

### Completed
* Test and write function for positive integer addition
* Test and modify code for negative integer addition
  * Multiple approaches have been tried in the pursuit of increasing efficiency though steps have not been taken at this point to quantify improvements
