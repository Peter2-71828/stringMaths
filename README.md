# stringMaths

## Aims
* Create functions in javascript to perform mathematical operations on numbers saved as strings. The motivation of this is to expand the range of numbers that can be saved and manipulated beyond what is possible with standard datatypes.
* Investigate writing the algorithms in C++ and utilising them in javascript and any efficiency benefits 
* Possibly look at creating a module from the resulting functions
